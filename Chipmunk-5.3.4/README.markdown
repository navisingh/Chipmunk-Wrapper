Chipmunk: just my personal copy of chipmunk 5.3.4 - will contain all my tweaks.
=============================================================

What is Chipmunk?
----------------
 
See original chipumunk at http://code.google.com/p/chipmunk-physics

Who is this library for?
-------------------
 
Initially me :)  Then as I tweak it to be more generalized, anyone is welcome to use it.
Though my tweaks will be specific to Sparrow.

and Eskipol's extension at:

They are definitely more than what I have to offer for now.
